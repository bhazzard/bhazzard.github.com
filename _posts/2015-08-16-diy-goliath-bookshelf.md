We are trying to save as much as we can so that we can remodel our kitchen ASAP, so we have started trying our hand at building some of our own furniture. Technically, our first project was a <a target="_blank" href="/home/2012/09/02/how-to-build-a-floating-headboard/">floating headboard</a> a few years ago. It was a simple project that didn't require any sawing, drilling, or screwing.

Our first “real” build was a table to house our Big Green Egg (post coming soon). It was  frustrating, but I guess that’s what you can expect for my first time using pretty much any of the tools I own. The end result was glorious, and well worth the effort.

For our second project we decided one of the empty walls in our living room needed a bookcase, and since we have 22’ vaulted ceilings, it needed to be big. Specifically, we wanted to build it to be 7 feet tall, and 4 feet wide. I dubbed the project our "Goliath" shelf. As you can see, it turned out great.

We based our plans off of this plan from Ana-White.com, but modified it greatly to meet our needs. First, we made it taller and wider. We swapped 2X12X8's for the outer boards to give it a substantial appearance. Finally, we removed the vertical shelf dividers; we thought they would be too much, and since we added an extra shelf to make it taller, the pattern would have been asymmetrical.

#Plans

Supplies:
=========
- 3 - 2x12x8 Yellow Pine
- 3 - 1x12x8 White Spruce
- Sandpaper
- <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/1PkUgbO">Pocket Screws</a>
- Wood pre-stain, <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/1PkUobh">Minwax Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner</a>
- Stain, <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/1PkUkIC">Minwax Dark Walnut</a>
- Foam brushes
- 4 - L brackets
- Drop cloth

Tools:
======
- <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/1Mxu0Mh">Kreg Jig</a>
- Clamp
- Miter saw
- Drill
- Sander

Cut List:
=========
- 2 - 2x12 @ 84”
- 2 - 2x12 @ 48”
- 5 - 1x12 @ 48”

Instructions:
=============
1. Cut boards according to the cut list above.
2. Drill pocket holes. You will need to use the Kreg Jig to drill 4 pocket holes for each of the 48 inch boards. Follow the Jig's instructions to make sure that you drill the appropriate depths.
3. Sand each board to provide an even surface for staining. I'll be honest, I'm not sure this step is all that important, but serious woodworkers seem to swear by it.
4. Apply pre-stain. This is especially important when using cheap, hard to stain woods like pine.
5. Stain the wood. It is a good idea to the try the stain out on a extra wood piece to check how long the stain should sit. I recommend doing this to make sure get the color you desire. It turned out for us, the time didn’t really seem to matter and the 5, 10, & 15 min sections all looked the same. Here is a photo during the staining process. You can see the wood in all the different stages: <img alt="Staining Process" src="/assets/images/bookshelf/staining_process.JPG" style="width: 575px;"></img>
6. Measure between the shelves evenly and drill a pilot hole through the pocket hole. Otherwise, you'll get gaps between the shelves and sides.
7. Screw in the shelves, and stand it up.
8. It'll be wobbly, that's why you need the L-Brackets. Attach one to each corner of the bookshelf on the backside.

And thats it, you have yourself a bookshelf! Here is our finished product:

We are still searching for the perfect decor, but honestly it will probably stay like this for a while. We even found a way to get some of our boardgames into the living room without being an eyesore. Those bottom baskets are filled with boardgames!

Notes:
- We purchased all our wood from 84 lumber, as they were the only place we could find that carried 2x12x8
- We ended up using 2 different kinds of wood because 84 Lumber didn’t have the 1x12 and 2x12 in the same species. With our dark stain, you couldn’t tell the difference.
- Baskets are from IKEA, they are the BRANÄS baskets in "rattan"
