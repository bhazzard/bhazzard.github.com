So your best friend is pregnant, and you want to give them something that comes
from the heart, but also has a down-to-earth, utilitarian purpose? Good news, I
have just the right gift idea for you. A Diaper cake!

It's got all the decorative beauty of a wedding cake, and all the sensibility of
a box of diapers. My wife made one for her best friend, and just look at the results:

Cool! Teach Me How!
-------------------
It's a piece of cake to make a diaper cake! I'll tell you what materials you
need, and the method for putting them together.

Materials
---------
First you'll diapers, and lots of them. To be precise, the cake above, my wife
used 60 diapers. I recommend the [Huggies New Born 76 Pack](http://amzn.to/ZH6Icf).

Next you'll need a rubber band or some twine to bind each cake layer in its shape.
You'll also need a couple of wide ribbons in two complementary colors of your
choice. My wife went with pink and green because her friend is having a girl.

Now, this might sound weird, since you don't actually cook a diaper cake, but you're
going to need two saute pans (one large, one medium), and a small pot. These will be
your guides to help you size the cake layers.

Lastly, you can spruce it up with extra decorations. My wife used a pink prize
ribbon and a fluffy pink tiara.

Method

Shove 30 diapers into the bottom layer and then spread them until there is a
hole approximately in the center, and the edges look about the way you want. The
diapers should be approximately 1/2 an inch apart.

Before you remove the diapers from the pan, put your rubber band (or twine) around
the diapers to hold the shape.

Repeat the above with 20 diapers and the medium pan, and then again with 10
diapers in the small pot.

Once you have your three cake layers, simply tape the ribbons to themselves. DO
NOT TAPE TO THE DIAPERS... you want them to be usable.

There you have it. A totally functional and useful gift from the heart. Enjoy!
