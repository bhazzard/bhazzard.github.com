Recently my wife was throwing a baby shower for a dear friend. Because she is
an absolute nut for delicious homemade food, she took the responsibility to feed
her guests very seriously. I had the privilege of helping her taste-test many of
the foods that she was considering for the menu.

One of the awesome recipes that made the final menu was Pioneer Woman's
Stuffed Mushrooms. This is a mouthwatering appetizer of mushrooms filled with
a hot italian sausage, thyme, and cream cheese stuffing. She calls for white
button mushrooms, be we prefer portobello, so we made the adjustment to use
baby bellas.

These tasty mushroom morsels were a hit at the baby shower. Sadly, that meant
there were no leftover stuffed mushrooms for me to enjoy. But there was some
leftover stuffing mixtureâ€¦ I knew we couldn't let mushroomy, sausagey goodness
go to waste. So I enlisted my wife's creativity to come up with a scrumptious
way to use the leftovers.

What could be better than a quiche filled with portobella mushroom, sausage,
and cream cheese? Answer: who cares. This is freaking awesome! She based
the quiche off of the "Basic Cheese Quiche" from Mark Bittman's "How to Cook
Everything". But she dropped the crust, and most of the cheese.

Here's our adjusted recipe:

Quiche with Mushroom and Sausage
================================
- 6 Eggs (room temperature)
- 2 cups Milk (we used skim)
- 2 tablespoons Cream Cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt
- 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne
- 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese, shredded
- 1 recipe Pioneer Woman's Stuffed Mushroom Filling (below)

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees
2. Gently heat milk and cream cheese in a pot until warm and cream cheese is melted
3. Combine eggs, milk/cream cheese mixture, and seasoning, and beat until well blended
4. Add stuffed mushroom filling and parmesan cheese and mix well
5. Pour mixture into a 9-inch deep dish pie pan
6. Bake 30-40 minutes, until mixture is set, but still moist. It should still jiggle in the middle.
7. Cool on a rack and serve warm or at room temperature. (We ate it as soon as the risk
for severe mouth burns had subsided)

Stuffed Mushroom Filling
========================
- 4 ounces, weight Baby Bella mushrooms, chopped finely
- 1/3 pound Hot Pork Sausage
- 1/2 medium Onion, diced
- 4 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1/3 cup Dry White Wine

1. Brown and crumble sausage. Set aside on a plate to cool
2. Add onions and garlic to the same skillet; cook for 2 minutes over medium low heat
3. Pour in wine to deglaze pan, allow liquid to evaporate
4. Add mushrooms, stir to cook for 2 minutes
5. Add salt and pepper to taste
6. Set mixture aside on a plate to cool
