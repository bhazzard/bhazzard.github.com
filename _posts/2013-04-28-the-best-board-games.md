I play board games one or two times a week. I think that they are a fantastic
way to engage with a group of friends or family. The best board games can ignite
a healthy competitive spirit, or exercise team work. The best board games can be
silly fun, or intensely strategic.

So, if you are looking for a cheap way to have a fun and engaging evening with
friends or family, I hope you'll find my list of the best board games helpful.

Ticket to Ride
===================

Why it's one of the best board games
------------------------------------
Ticket to Ride is the epitomy of simple rules that somehow manage to provide a
depth of strategy and tactics that can bring out the gamer in anyone. This one
has universal appeal.

My wife is ga-ga for Ticket to Ride, and simply refers to it as "trains", as in
"let's play Trains!". If you think you like board games, there is simply no
reason not to own this one.

- Accessible rules
- Lots of small decisions
- Can be played friendly, or cutthroat

Dominion
===================
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JQY6K4/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001JQY6K4&linkCode=as2&tag=briahazzcons-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B001JQY6K4&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=briahazzcons-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=briahazzcons-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001JQY6K4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Why it's one of the best board games
------------------------------------
Dominion is another game with relatively simple rules, but what makes it special
is the almost infinite variety packed into the box. The game includes 25 types
of cards, and any given game uses 10 of them. Throughout the game each player
builds up their own personal deck to play with. This one also has universal
appeal.

- Innovative "Deck Building" Mechanism
- Tons of variety and replayability
- Fascinating card interactions

Pandemic
===================
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OBXG2/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0013OBXG2&linkCode=as2&tag=briahazzcons-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OBXG2&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=briahazzcons-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=briahazzcons-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0013OBXG2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Why it's one of the best board games
------------------------------------
In Pandemic, players work together to save humanity from global outbreaks. Who
would have thought that team work could be so fun! Pandemic is awesome for any
situation, but it is a god-send for families with kids who are prone to arguing
or whining in competitive games when things don't go their way.

- Super awesome theme
- Teamwork, rather than competition
- Fun, puzzly challenge

The Resistance
===================
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008A2BA8G/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008A2BA8G&linkCode=as2&tag=briahazzcons-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B008A2BA8G&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=briahazzcons-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=briahazzcons-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B008A2BA8G" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Why it's one of the best board games
------------------------------------
The Resistance is NOT for the faint of heart. Believe it or not, this board game
will have your heart pounding throughout it's 30 minute playing time. In my
experience, almost every play of this is followed by the phrase "lets go again!"

Most players are loyal members of the resistance, but a few are spies for the
corrupt goverment. The spies know each other's identities, but everyone else is
in the dark. The game is about deduction and deceipt... and it is a blast!

- Panic-inducing suspenseful gameplay
- A shouting match has never been so fun!

Why it's one of the best board games
------------------------------------
In Stone Age, players build up a tribe of workers and deploy them to gather
resources, and develop culture. The best part is that it lets you experience the
thrill and luck of the dice, without being a slave to their unlucky whims. 

- Mitigated luck
- A smelly leather cup

Space Alert
===================

Why it's one of the best board games
------------------------------------
*WARNING* This one isn't for everyone *WARNING* It's fairly complex, and takes
several plays just to learn the basic rules. On the other hand, the time
investment is worth it if you like science fiction and team work.

Space Alert is a real-time, cooperative game. It doesn't have turns. Instead
a soundtrack provides a timer mechanism and announces the arrival of enemies. I
can't really describe how crazy this game can get.

- Unique real-time play
- Chaotic gameplay
- Awesome teamwork
