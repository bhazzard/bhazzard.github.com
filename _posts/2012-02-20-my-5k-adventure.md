This weekend I did something I usually don't do... I moved. In fact, not only
did I move, I ran a 5k. Now if you know me, right now you are probably in
disbelief. I'm not what you would call an athelete. And true to form, I didn't
train for this event beyond running a couple of miles one time, the week before
the event.

So on Saturday, when I showed up at the school where the race would be started
and saw enthusiastic and seasoned runners, I felt a little out of place. Luckily
as time went by and my wife and friends waited for the event to start, I saw
fellow renegade couch potatoes begin to trickle in. Some even had a body shape
that was less [Rosie Huntington](http://www.wordsaboutthings.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/rosie-huntington-whiteley-transformers.jpg),
and more [Rosie O'Donnell](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RY-nwD2NQHs/TukrcaGWpcI/AAAAAAAAAjg/VJHl7Z1Ekr8/s1600/rosie-odonnell.jpg).

I'm not making fun. Actually, I found it inspiring. If you didn't know this,
people of all shapes and sizes get off their asses on the weekends to do things.
I didn't know it, but now I do, and I think I will join them. You should too.
