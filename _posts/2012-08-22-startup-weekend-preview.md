As I'm writing this, I'm practically SHAKING in anticipation and excitement for 
Startup Weekend Blacksburg. I'm serious, this event is going to be AMAZING!

Alright you caught me, I'm a bit biased because I'm on the team of organizers
making this event happen. So let me explain why I think my Blacksburg readers
should be just as excited as I am...

Amazing People
--------------
This is a ticketed event, and the tickets aren't cheap. We're talking $99 a pop.
Why is this a good thing? Because it ensure that the people who are attending
the event are others who are super excited about building something amazing.
Excited enough to plop down $99 just to work with like-minded people who want
to do the same thing.

Even More Amazing People
------------------------
On top of entusiastic participants, we have built a team of extremely knowledgeable
and talented mentors to help guide you along your path. We're talking social media
guru's, business law professionals, expert software developers, designers, and
business moguls. And their only job for the weekend, is to help you succeed.

Awesome Opportunities
---------------------
Some amazing businesses have been built during Startup Weekend events around the
world. One of my favorite examples is [Foodspotting](http://www.foodspotting.com/),
which lets you recommend your favorite dishes using photos. Super cool.

At our event, we will have some high profile individuals who are well connected
in the world of angel investors, venture capitalists, and funds. If your idea
needs dollars to make it a reality, this is a great event to help you get exposure.

Furthermore, the winning team will get a chance to pitch at ["Small Bucks, Big
Bang!"](http://www.nextthreedays.com/FeaturedEventDetails.cfm?E=116151). This is
an event being held later in September, where among others you can pitch your
business to  Ian Sobieski, founder and managing director of Band of Angels,
"Silicon Valley's oldest seed funding organization."

Be There!
