So last week Brian and I got some great news… after 14 months, one surgery, and multiple months on medication, we are PREGNANT!!!!

Since most of our family lives at least 3 hours away from us, we wanted to have a way for everyone to still be apart of this journey even if they don’t get to see us every week. Our plan is to update this as often as possible (hopefully every week) with a little insight into what is happening in our lives and how the pregnancy is progressing. So here we go!

This is week 4!
The baby is the size of poppyseed

I've gained: 0 lbs
I've been craving: nothing really, but I did really enjoy some maple and bacon donuts from Duck Donuts when I we were visiting NOVA over the weekend. I am not usually a sweets person and I have never had an interest in donuts, but I was actually they one who suggested checking the place out and Brian gladly obliged
I've been grossed out by: nothing so far!

What’s been going on: This past week has been a roller coaster of emotions. We first found out I was pregnant Saturday (March 5th), which was pretty early, as it was still 4 days before a missed period. Over the next week I took 2 blood tests (beta hCG) to verify that I was pregnant and that everything was growing properly at that time. I did this, because I actually had a miscarriage at 4 weeks 2 days back in January, so I wanted to make sure everything was going well before I got too excited.

On Thursday we drove home to visit some family and were able to tell Teresa and Bob on Thursday evening by giving them this book:

And we told Ruth, Bob, & Erica on Friday by putting Aria in this outfit:

I've been feeling: I haven’t been having very many symptoms, mostly bloat and soreness/cramping. At first I was worried, but after getting one more blood test from my doctor I am finally just relaxing and relishing in the fact that I feel great at this moment.
I've been missing: Nothing yet!
I'm looking forward to: telling the world about the pregnancy!

The best thing about pregnancy this week: The excitement of just finding out and getting to share the news with our family and friends
The worst thing about pregnancy this week: I haven’t been sleeping as well as usual at night and my back has been pretty sore.
