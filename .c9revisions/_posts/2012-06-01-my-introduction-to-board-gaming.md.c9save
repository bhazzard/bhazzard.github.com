My wife and I had\nmoved far from all of our friends and family. The town was Helena, Montana...\nit was colder and quieter than we were used to, being from the active and highly\npopulated Northern Virginia. Fortunately, I liked a few of my co-workers.\n\nOne of them pulled out a game called Masterpiece: The Art Auction Game at a\nweekend mixer. I barely remember the game now, but I really enjoyed it. Most\nimportantly, it planted a seed in my mind that there was a whole unexplored\nworld of games out there.\n\nFast forward a few months... I had been at that job for almost a year, and I was\nfinally fed up with the tedium of it all; it wasn't a good fit for my interests.\nI took a job with a company that really has an innovative and exciting culture.\nBesides people who were incredibly enthusiastic to do their job, there were dogs\nat work, beer kegs for after work parties, a ping-pong table, and... there were\nboard games.\n\nOne of my coworkers had Settlers of Catan on his desk. I hadn't heard of it, so\nI asked him about it. He said it was a \"euro-game\" and that he and some\ncoworkers played pretty often. He also invited me to join them that week. It was\na lot of fun, and I became a permanent fixture at their Settler's nights.\n\nEventually expansions made their way into the picture... we enjoyed them at\nfirst, but eventually they killed the game for us, and the group sort of\nevaporated for a while.\n\nNow I had an itch, and no way to scratch it. So I started to obsessively scour\nthe internet for information on board games. That's when I discovered\n\"The Geek\". I started reading reviews, listening to The Dice Tower podcasts, and\nwatching Tom Vassel's videos.\n\nI ordered a few games: Citadel's, Incan Gold, and Pandemic. My wife really liked\nCitadel's, so I promptly ordered a few more games while I had the go ahead: Race\nfor the Galaxy, and Cash 'n Guns.\n\nAround this time, I was talking to a co-worker and friend, and convinced him\nthat it would be a good idea to start up a regular gaming group. He ordered a\ncouple of great games and set up a mailing list. The list now has over 20\npeople, but between 3 and 8 people show up every week for our game night.\n\nI still enjoy some of those mass market games every once in a while with\nnon-gaming friends. Mostly those who are not convinced learning games they've\nnever heard of is worth their time. But I would say I am at the beginning of a\nlong \"career\" as a gamer.\n\nThanks for reading, and good gaming!"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2785}]],"length":2785}
